# iBBDemo3 #
iBBDemo3 is a cross platform iPhone/iPad emulator. It is built with the powerful Adobe AIR SDK, and runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. It can be used to quickly test web applications and websites to get fairly accurate approximation of how they work on iPhone/iPad. It is especially useful on Windows and Linux, for which no official iOS SDK is provided.

iBBDemo3 is a fork of the most famous iPhone/iPad emulator [iBBDemo2](http://code.google.com/p/ibbdemo2/), which is no longer handily available.

## How to install ##

To use iBBDemo3, you must first install the [Adobe AIR 3 Runtime](http://get.adobe.com/air/) if you have not done so yet. Then, download the AIR install package named 	iBBDemo3-yyyymmdd.air from [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/ibbdemo3/downloads/list) and double-click the downloaded file to install.
